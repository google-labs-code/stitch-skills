# Stitch Build Loop

You are an **autonomous frontend builder** participating in an iterative site-building loop. Your goal is to generate a page using Stitch, integrate it into the site, and prepare instructions for the next iteration.

## Overview

The Build Loop pattern enables continuous, autonomous website development through a "baton" system. Each iteration:
1. Reads the current task from a baton file (`.stitch/next-prompt.md`)
2. Generates a page using Stitch MCP tools
3. Integrates the page into the site structure
4. Writes the next task to the baton file for the next iteration

## Prerequisites

**Required:**
- Access to the Stitch MCP Server
- A Stitch project (existing or will be created)
- A `.stitch/DESIGN.md` file (generate one using the `design-md` skill if needed)
- A `.stitch/SITE.md` file documenting the site vision and roadmap

**Optional:**
- Chrome DevTools MCP Server — enables visual verification of generated pages

## The Baton System

The `.stitch/next-prompt.md` file acts as a relay baton between iterations:

```markdown
---
page: about
---
A page describing how jules.top tracking works.

**DESIGN SYSTEM (REQUIRED):**
[Copy from .stitch/DESIGN.md Section 6]

**Page Structure:**
1. Header with navigation
2. Explanation of tracking methodology
3. Footer with links
```

**Critical rules:**
- The `page` field in YAML frontmatter determines the output filename
- The prompt content must include the design system block from `.stitch/DESIGN.md`
- You MUST update this file before completing your work to continue the loop

## Execution Protocol

### Step 1: Read the Baton

Parse `.stitch/next-prompt.md` to extract:
- **Page name** from the `page` frontmatter field
- **Prompt content** from the markdown body

### Step 2: Consult Context Files

Before generating, read these files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.stitch/SITE.md` | Site vision, **Stitch Project ID**, existing pages (sitemap), roadmap |
| `.stitch/DESIGN.md` | Required visual style for Stitch prompts |

**Important checks:**
- Section 4 (Sitemap) — Do NOT recreate pages that already exist
- Section 5 (Roadmap) — Pick tasks from here if backlog exists
- Section 6 (Creative Freedom) — Ideas for new pages if roadmap is empty

### Step 3: Generate with Stitch

Use the Stitch MCP tools to generate the page:

1. **Discover namespace**: Run `list_tools` to find the Stitch MCP prefix
2. **Get or create project**: 
   - If `.stitch/metadata.json` exists, use the `projectId` from it
   - Otherwise, call `[prefix]:create_project`, then call `[prefix]:get_project` to retrieve full project details, and save them to `.stitch/metadata.json` (see schema below)
   - After generating each screen, call `[prefix]:get_project` again and update the `screens` map in `.stitch/metadata.json` with each screen's full metadata (id, sourceScreen, dimensions, canvas position)
3. **Generate screen**: Call `[prefix]:generate_screen_from_text` with:
   - `projectId`: The project ID
   - `prompt`: The full prompt from the baton (including design system block)
   - `deviceType`: `DESKTOP` (or as specified)
4. **Retrieve assets**: Before downloading, check if `.stitch/designs/{page}.html` and `.stitch/designs/{page}.png` already exist:
   - **If files exist**: Ask the user whether to refresh the designs from the Stitch project or reuse the existing local files. Only re-download if the user confirms.
   - **If files do not exist**: Proceed with download:
     - `htmlCode.downloadUrl` — Download and save as `.stitch/designs/{page}.html`
      - `screenshot.downloadUrl` — Append `=w{width}` to the URL before downloading, where `{width}` is the `width` value from the screen metadata (Google CDN serves low-res thumbnails by default). Save as `.stitch/designs/{page}.png`

### Step 4: Integrate into Site

1. Move generated HTML from `.stitch/designs/{page}.html` to `site/public/{page}.html`
2. Fix any asset paths to be relative to the public folder
3. Update navigation:
   - Find existing placeholder links (e.g., `href="#"`) and wire them to the new page
   - Add the new page to the global navigation if appropriate
4. Ensure consistent headers/footers across all pages

### Step 4.5: Visual Verification (Optional)

If the **Chrome DevTools MCP Server** is available, verify the generated page:

1. **Check availability**: Run `list_tools` to see if `chrome*` tools are present
2. **Start dev server**: Use Bash to start a local server (e.g., `npx serve site/public`)
3. **Navigate to page**: Call `[chrome_prefix]:navigate` to open `http://localhost:3000/{page}.html`
4. **Capture screenshot**: Call `[chrome_prefix]:screenshot` to capture the rendered page
5. **Visual comparison**: Compare against the Stitch screenshot (`.stitch/designs/{page}.png`) for fidelity
6. **Stop server**: Terminate the dev server process

> **Note:** This step is optional. If Chrome DevTools MCP is not installed, skip to Step 5.

### Step 5: Update Site Documentation

Modify `.stitch/SITE.md`:
- Add the new page to Section 4 (Sitemap) with `[x]`
- Remove any idea you consumed from Section 6 (Creative Freedom)
- Update Section 5 (Roadmap) if you completed a backlog item

### Step 6: Prepare the Next Baton (Critical)

**You MUST update `.stitch/next-prompt.md` before completing.** This keeps the loop alive.

1. **Decide the next page**: 
   - Check `.stitch/SITE.md` Section 5 (Roadmap) for pending items
   - If empty, pick from Section 6 (Creative Freedom)
   - Or invent something new that fits the site vision
2. **Write the baton** with proper YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
page: achievements
---
A competitive achievements page showing developer badges and milestones.

**DESIGN SYSTEM (REQUIRED):**
[Copy the entire design system block from .stitch/DESIGN.md]

**Page Structure:**
1. Header with title and navigation
2. Badge grid showing unlocked/locked states
3. Progress bars for milestone tracking
```

### `.stitch/metadata.json` Schema

This file persists all Stitch identifiers so future iterations can reference them for edits or variants. Populate it by calling `[prefix]:get_project` after creating a project or generating screens.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Full resource name (`projects/{id}`) |
| `projectId` | Stitch project ID (from `create_project` or `get_project`) |
| `title` | Human-readable project title |
| `designTheme` | Design system tokens: color mode, font, roundness, custom color, saturation |
| `deviceType` | Target device: `MOBILE`, `DESKTOP`, `TABLET` |
| `screens` | Map of page name → screen object. Each screen includes `id`, `sourceScreen` (resource path for MCP calls), canvas position (`x`, `y`), and dimensions (`width`, `height`) |
| `metadata.userRole` | User's role on the project (`OWNER`, `EDITOR`, `VIEWER`) |

## Orchestration Options

The loop can be driven by different orchestration layers:

| Method | How it works |
|--------|--------------|
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions triggers on `.stitch/next-prompt.md` changes |
| **Human-in-loop** | Developer reviews each iteration before continuing |
| **Agent chains** | One agent dispatches to another (e.g., Jules API) |
| **Manual** | Developer runs the agent repeatedly with the same repo |

The skill is orchestration-agnostic — focus on the pattern, not the trigger mechanism.

## Design System Integration

This skill works best with the `design-md` skill:

1. **First time setup**: Generate `.stitch/DESIGN.md` using the `design-md` skill from an existing Stitch screen
2. **Every iteration**: Copy Section 6 ("Design System Notes for Stitch Generation") into your baton prompt
3. **Consistency**: All generated pages will share the same visual language

## Common Pitfalls

- ❌ Forgetting to update `.stitch/next-prompt.md` (breaks the loop)
- ❌ Recreating a page that already exists in the sitemap
- ❌ Not including the design system block from `.stitch/DESIGN.md` in the prompt
- ❌ Leaving placeholder links (`href="#"`) instead of wiring real navigation
- ❌ Forgetting to persist `.stitch/metadata.json` after creating a new project

## Examples

### Example 1: First iteration on a fresh project

The user has run `design-md` and has a `.stitch/DESIGN.md` and `.stitch/SITE.md` ready. The baton (`.stitch/next-prompt.md`) requests an `about` page:

1. Read the baton; extract `page: about` and the prompt body
2. Read `.stitch/SITE.md`: confirm `about` is not already in the sitemap
3. Read `.stitch/DESIGN.md` Section 6 and confirm it is in the baton prompt
4. Call `[prefix]:create_project` (no metadata.json yet), then `get_project`, save to `.stitch/metadata.json`
5. Call `generate_screen_from_text` with the baton prompt
6. Download HTML and screenshot (with the `=w{width}` suffix on the screenshot URL)
7. Move HTML to `site/public/about.html`, fix asset paths
8. Update `.stitch/SITE.md` sitemap with `[x] about`
9. Pick `pricing` from the roadmap and write the next baton

### Example 2: Subsequent iteration with existing local files

The user re-runs the loop and `.stitch/designs/about.html` already exists from a prior run:

1. Read the baton; the page is still `about`
2. At the asset download step, detect both files exist
3. Ask the user "Refresh the design from Stitch, or reuse the local files?"
4. On "reuse", skip download and continue at the integrate-into-site step
5. Update the sitemap and write the next baton as usual

### Example 3: Visual verification with Chrome DevTools MCP

The Chrome DevTools MCP is connected. After integrating the page:

1. Run `list_tools` and find tools prefixed `chrome:`
2. Start a local server with `npx serve site/public` in the background
3. Call `[chrome_prefix]:navigate` to `http://localhost:3000/about.html`
4. Capture a screenshot, compare against `.stitch/designs/about.png`
5. If layout drifts, adjust the integration (asset paths, missing CSS) and re-verify
6. Stop the dev server and continue to the documentation update

## Error Handling

| Issue | Likely cause | What to do |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| Stitch generation fails | Prompt is missing the design system block | Re-read the baton; confirm Section 6 of `.stitch/DESIGN.md` is included verbatim |
| Inconsistent styles across pages | `.stitch/DESIGN.md` outdated or copied incompletely | Regenerate DESIGN.md with the `design-md` skill, then update the baton template |
| Loop stalls (no next baton) | Prior iteration finished without writing `.stitch/next-prompt.md` | Read `.stitch/SITE.md` Sections 5 and 6; pick the next page and write a baton manually |
| Navigation broken in the integrated page | Internal links still use `href="#"` placeholders or absolute paths to `.stitch/designs/` | Replace placeholders with the correct relative path inside `site/public/` |
| `.stitch/metadata.json` missing screen entries | `get_project` was not re-called after each `generate_screen_from_text` | Call `get_project` again and merge each screen's `id`, `sourceScreen`, `width`, `height`, `x`, `y` into the `screens` map |
| Screenshot shows the wrong page | The Stitch CDN cached a previous version, or the `screenshotUrl` field was stale | Re-call `get_screen` to refresh URLs before downloading |
| `chrome:navigate` fails in step 4.5 | Local server did not start, or wrong port | Confirm the dev server PID and port; if Chrome DevTools MCP is unavailable at all, skip step 4.5 |
| YAML frontmatter rejected | Stray quotes or missing `---` delimiters in `next-prompt.md` | Rewrite the frontmatter with strict YAML; only `page:` is required, no quotes around the value |
| Page recreated despite existing in sitemap | Sitemap not consulted before generation | Always read Section 4 of `.stitch/SITE.md` before calling `generate_screen_from_text` |

If `generate_screen_from_text` returns success but the resulting screen is empty or off-brand, do NOT silently regenerate. Surface the failure to the user with the request payload and the returned screen ID, so they can inspect the project in Stitch directly.
